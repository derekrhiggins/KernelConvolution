=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

On startup the user is presented with the program's "CURRENT SETTINGS" and a list of "AVAILABLE COMMANDS". The user is then prompted to enter a command.

The available COMMANDS are as follows:

HELP - Displays the list of available commands.

SET - This command appended with an argument can be used to alter the behaviour of the program. Legitimate arguments are as follows;

	SET filter - This generates a menu where the user can choose a filter from a list of those available or choose to apply all filters. 

	SET inputFolder - The user can set the inputFolder from which to load the image file.

	SET inputFile - The user can enter a filename, a URL beginning with http:// or https:// or enter * to select all .png files within the inputFolder chosen.

	SET outputFolder - The user can set the outputFolder. If the folder does not exist the user will be prompted if they wish to create it.

	SET outputFile - The user can set the output filename excluding the file extension. Depending on the state of the appendfilter setting the chosen filter name will be appended to the filename enterred.

	SET appendfilter - This sets a flag to append the chosen filter name to the output filename i.e. [OUTPUT_NAME]_LAPLACIAN.png

SHOW - This will display the state of the program settings which can be modified by the user using the SET command.

RUN - This will execute the selected filter or all selected filters as the case may be on the chosen input file or files and output to the folder specified.

QUIT - This will exit the program.
